# Aruco Test Viewer

This is a little application which creates an UI with which one can change the
parameters of the aruco detection with OpenCV and see the results in the
different steps visualized. This should make the selection of parameters for a
certain recording easier.

This application essentially copies the private implementation of OpenCV. The
OpenCV version currently recreated is 4.5.5 (note that the aruco detection was
reworked since then)

> NOTE: Does (currently) not work with AprilTag

This application is based in part on the work of the FLTK project
(https://www.fltk.org) and OpenCV (https://www.opencv.org).
